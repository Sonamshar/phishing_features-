Phishing Detection Algorithm
Overview
This Python code snippet is a phishing detection algorithm that calculates the probability of an email being a phishing attempt based on various features extracted from the email text.

Features
The algorithm considers the following features:

contains_http: Presence of "http" in the email text.
contains_https: Presence of "https" in the email text.
contains_at: Presence of "@" in the email text.
contains_dot: Presence of "." in the email text.
contains_dollar: Presence of "$" in the email text.
contains_exclamation: Presence of "!" in the email text.
contains_question: Presence of "?" in the email text.
contains_percent: Presence of "%" in the email text.
contains_number: Presence of numeric characters in the email text.
word_count: Total number of words in the email text.
avg_word_length: Average length of words in the email text.
Usage
To use the algorithm, provide the email_text and words variables containing the email text and a list of words respectively. Then, calculate the phishing probability using the provided formula.

python
Copy code
phishing_proba = sum(1 for feature in phishing_features.values() if feature) / len(phishing_features)
return phishing_proba > 0.5
A phishing probability greater than 0.5 indicates a high likelihood of the email being a phishing attempt.

Note
This algorithm provides a basic phishing detection mechanism and may require further refinement and tuning for specific use cases.
Ensure that the email_text variable contains the raw text of the email to be analyzed.
